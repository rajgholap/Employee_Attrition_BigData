# Employee_Attrition_BigData
Employee attrition prediction - Pyspark ETL &amp; ML Algorithms

The Employee Attrition Prediction model evaluates the attrition risk for your employee populations in real-time
owing to unavoidable variables like resignation for personal events, switching careers, lack of growth opportunities.
To investigate how the company objective factors influence in attrition and what kind of working environment
likely to cause attrition we applied machine learning algorithms on dataset such as logistic regression, decision tree,
etc. to solve the given business problem.

Module used :
Pyspark - For ETL process
MongoDB - For storing data in two different collections i.e. One for Machine Learning & Other for Visualization
Machine Learning - Used various classification algorithms for predictions
Power BI - For visual insights of dataset
